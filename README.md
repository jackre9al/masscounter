# Mass Gainer Logger — Sticky + Auto Actions

What’s new
- **Header stays fixed** while logs scroll behind it.
- **Date picker** closes itself after you tap a date (final tap = done).
- **Number pad “Done”** now auto-adds the entry (triggers on `change` and `Enter`).

Everything else stays the same: segmented time with auto-jump, edit/delete, Last 7 days + Last Week total + Grand Total.

Deploy: replace files, commit, and hard refresh on iPhone if cached.
